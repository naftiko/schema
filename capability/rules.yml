  json-schema-2020-12-id-error:
    description: Each JSON Schema object MUST have a unique identifier, represented as a URL pointing to its location. The $id property in JSON Schema is used to establish the source of truth for any object being defined and validated.
    given: $
    severity: error
    then:
      field: "$id"
      function: truthy

  json-schema-2020-12-title-error:
    description: JSON Schema objects MUST include a title property that describes the object in plain language while reflecting the object's file name. The title should convey the object's content and purpose, providing clarity on how it is intended to be used.
    given: $
    severity: error
    then:
      field: title
      function: truthy    

  json-schema-2020-12-title-pascal-case-info:
    description: The name of a JSON Schema object should always be in PascalCase to ensure readability and consistency across APIs. Using PascalCase helps maintain uniformity and aligns the object's name with its plain-language title.
    given: $

    then:
      - field: title
        function: pattern

      field: description
      function: truthy

  json-schema-2020-12-type-error:
