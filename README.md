# Capabilities
This is for managing the schema for the capabilities manifest. This schema is just echoing the [product domain metamodel](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1zYfV1_xh7PuO3-7lcxrM-ps-lPdEDuGdOyYDu0rIFP0/edit?slide=id.g360f05e73a5_0_0#slide=id.g360f05e73a5_0_0), and will be running experiments to explore what is possible. 

The goal is define a JSON Schema v2020-12 for the capabilities manifest, and provide working examples for our leading use cases, to provide an artifact that reflects the core domain metamodel.
